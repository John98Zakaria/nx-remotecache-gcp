# nx-remotecache-gcp

A task runner for [@nrwl/nx](https://nx.dev) that uses a Google Cloud Storage bucket as a remote cache.
This enables all team members and CI servers to share a single cache.
The concept and benefits of [Cache Task Results](https://nx.dev/core-features/cache-task-results) are explained in the
Nx documentation.

This package was built with [nx-remotecache-custom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx-remotecache-custom) ðŸ™Œ

## Setup

1. Add Nx to your workspace [guide](https://nx.dev/getting-started/installation)
2. Install this package as dev dependency.
    ```shell
    npm install --save-dev nx-remotecache-gcp
    ```
3. Authenticate to Google Cloud
   The user authenticating must have read/write access to the bucket as well as `storage.buckets.get` permission
    1. Locally using google cloud CLI using `gcloud auth`
    2. For Github actions use [google-github-actions/auth](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth)

4. Create a Google bucket to store the cache in

### Creating a service account with the right permissions

To authenticate on CI it is recommended to create a service account that only has the required
permissions.

1. Create a custom role with only the `storage.buckets.get` permission

2. Create a service account with the custom Role and limit it only manage the nx-cache bucket using
   this CEL Expression `resource.name.startsWith(\"projects/_/buckets/<nx_cache_bucket.name>\")`

3. Add Object Admin to the bucket from the page of the Bucket

| Bucket Name            | Bucket name in which the cache will be stored | `NXCACHE_GCP_BUCKET_NAME`   | `bucketName`         |
| Read from Remote Cache | Allow reading from the the remote cache       | `NXCACHE_READ`              | `read` (true/false)  |

```json
{
   "tasksRunnerOptions": {
      "default": {
         "runner": "nx-remotecache-gcp",
         "options": {
            "googleProject": "my-google-project-id",
            "bucketName": "my-nx-cache-bucket",
            "read": true,
            "write": false,
            "cacheableOperations": [
               "build",
               "test",
               "lint",
               "e2e"
            ]
         }
      }
   }
}
```

## Run it ðŸš€

Running tasks should now show the storage or retrieval from the remote cache:
